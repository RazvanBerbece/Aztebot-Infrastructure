#
# Shared Script - GCP Artifact Registry Docker Image Cleaner
#
# RULE
# Delete all unnecessary images such that for each image name there are at most 2-3 images stored at all times, 
# thus allowing rolling back at least 2-3 versions if needed.
#
# USAGE
# Run clear_stale_artifact_images.sh <ARG_DRY_RUN>
# Examples: clear_stale_artifact_images.sh 1 us-na1-docker.pkg.dev/DummyProject-420/my-ar (for a dry-run)
#           clear_stale_artifact_images.sh 0 us-na1-docker.pkg.dev/DummyProject-420/my-ar (for an actual run)
#

# Input Arguments
dry_run=$1 # 0=false (submit deletion requests), 1=true (don't perform any deletions)
repository=$2 # e.g.: us-na1-docker.pkg.dev/DummyProject-420/my-ar

# Variables
image_limit_per_service=2 # How many images to keep for each service (by name)

artifact_processed_lines=() # Will store lines of data retrieved from the AR (name digest created_at updated_at)
